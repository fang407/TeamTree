# Volc Agent Launchpad

A minimal Agent platform for three-day middleware hackathons. It provides Agent
CRUD, a browser Playground, persistent workspaces, and Codex CLI backed by the
Volcengine Ark Responses API.

Run it locally with Docker, Colima, or rootless Podman, or deploy it to
Volcengine ECS.

> [!WARNING]
> This is a single-user proof of concept. It includes a hackathon safety
> middleware and safety-event audit trail, but it is not a production identity,
> authorization, compliance, or hardened-sandbox solution. Do not use
> production data or credentials. See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).

## Features

- React and TypeScript Web UI
- Agent create, edit, start, stop, delete, and multi-turn chat
- Fastify control plane with asynchronous Run state
- Persistent Agent workspaces and Codex sessions
- Disposable Docker, Colima, or Podman container for each local turn
- Docker and Terraform deployment paths for Volcengine ECS
- Safety middleware for redaction, prompt-injection blocking, Runner lifecycle
  events, and a visible safety dashboard

## Hackathon safety middleware

### Problem

An Agent can receive credentials, personal data, or malicious instructions
before a user can understand what the system will do with them. This project
adds a real backend/runtime middleware boundary that makes those decisions
safer and visible: it redacts sensitive values, blocks high-risk prompt
injection, records Runner outcomes, and displays an auditable timeline.

### Design

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    User[User prompt] --> API[Fastify API]
    API --> Service[AgentService + SafetyMiddleware]
    Service -->|safe trace and events| Store[(JSON store)]
    Service -->|opaque placeholders| Runner[CodexRunner / ContainerCodexRunner]
    Values[Run Values] -->|temporary environment variables| Runner
    Runner -->|ALLOW / BLOCK / CANCELLED| Service
    Service --> Dashboard[Safety dashboard]
```

- **Detection and policy:** provider-secret, generic credential, PII, and
  prompt-injection rules run before execution.
- **Vault-backed protection:** matched inline values are persisted as stable
  redaction markers and reach the LLM only as opaque placeholders.
- **False-positive guardrails:** Shannon entropy plus an offline logistic score
  support generic credential detection; UUIDs, Git SHA values, and ordinary
  Base64 are suppressed.
- **Execution boundary:** local and container Runners emit start, timeout,
  cancellation, and output-limit safety events.
- **Dashboard:** the UI displays a status badge and real event timeline with
  boundary, decision, reason, and timestamp, without showing original secrets.

### Verify the implementation

```bash
npm run typecheck
npm run test
npm run build -w @launchpad/web
```

Automated tests cover redaction, injection blocking, Vault placeholders,
classifier look-alikes, UUID false-positive regression, safe persistence,
Runner events, cancellation, timeout, and output limits.

### Scope and no-secrets policy

This remains a single-user hackathon POC, not a production compliance or
security program. Pattern matching and a small offline classifier reduce risk
but cannot identify every sensitive value. Never commit `.env` files, API
keys, private keys, tokens, or Vault mappings; use fake provider-shaped values
in tests and use **Run Values** with `$VALUE_NAME` for temporary runtime
credentials.

For detailed setup, architecture rationale, limitations, and the live-demo
runbook, see [Hackathon demo and repository handoff](docs/HACKATHON_DEMO.md).

## Requirements

- Node.js 22+
- npm 10+
- Docker, Colima, or Podman
- A Volcengine Ark API key and endpoint that supports the Responses API

Codex CLI is included in the Runtime image and is not required on the host.

## Local browser SOP

### 1. Check the local tools

Install Node.js 22+ and one supported container engine, then verify them:

```bash
node --version
npm --version
docker --version        # Docker Desktop, Docker Engine, or Colima
podman --version        # Use this instead when running Podman
```

Only one container engine is required. Codex CLI is already included in the
Runtime image.

### 2. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone <repository-url> volc-agent-launchpad
cd volc-agent-launchpad
```

Skip this step when already working from the repository root.

### 3. Start the POC

```bash
ARK_API_KEY=your-ark-api-key \
ARK_MODEL=ep-your-endpoint-id \
npm run poc
```

The first run installs Node.js dependencies and builds the Runtime image. The
script automatically selects Docker, Colima, or Podman.

### 4. Open the browser

Visit <http://localhost:3000>, or open it from the terminal:

```bash
open http://localhost:3000       # macOS
xdg-open http://localhost:3000   # Linux desktop
```

In the Web UI:

1. Select **Create Agent**.
2. Enter a name, description, and workspace instructions.
3. Select **Create Agent** again.
4. Enter a task in the Playground, for example:

   ```text
   Create a TypeScript hello-world CLI, add a test, and run it.
   ```

The Agent can write files, run commands, and continue the same Codex session in
later messages.

### 5. Stop and resume

Press `Ctrl+C` in the startup terminal. The script removes temporary Runtime
containers but keeps Agent workspaces and conversations.

- macOS state: `~/.volc-agent-launchpad/`
- Linux state: `.local/`
- Custom location: set `LOCAL_POC_DATA_ROOT`

Run the same `npm run poc` command to continue later.

### Select a specific container engine

Force Podman when multiple engines are installed:

```bash
CONTAINER_ENGINE=podman \
ARK_API_KEY=your-ark-api-key \
ARK_MODEL=ep-your-endpoint-id \
npm run poc
```

Colima uses `CONTAINER_ENGINE=docker` because it exposes the Docker CLI.

For a clean Linux host, follow the
[rootless Podman setup](docs/LOCAL_POC.md#rootless-podman-on-linux).

## Docker Compose

Create and edit the configuration:

```bash
./scripts/bootstrap-local.sh
```

Required values in `.env`:

```dotenv
ARK_API_KEY=your-ark-api-key
ARK_MODEL=ep-your-endpoint-id
APP_AUTH_TOKEN=replace-with-at-least-24-random-characters
```

Start the application:

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

Open <http://localhost:3000>. Stop it without deleting Agent data:

```bash
docker compose down
```

## Development

```bash
npm install
cp .env.example .env
npm install --global @openai/codex@0.111.0
npm run dev
```

- Web UI: <http://localhost:5173>
- API: <http://localhost:3000>

Use local paths in `.env` when running outside Docker:

```dotenv
APP_DATA_DIR=.data
AGENT_WORKSPACE_ROOT=workspaces
CODEX_HOME=codex-home
```

## Deployment

- [Existing Linux ECS with Docker](docs/DEPLOYMENT.md#existing-linux-ecs)
- [Complete Volcengine environment with Terraform](docs/DEPLOYMENT.md#terraform-deployment)
- [Local Docker, Colima, and Podman details](docs/LOCAL_POC.md)

The existing-ECS script deploys from the current source tree:

```bash
cp .env.example .env.production
./scripts/deploy-existing-ecs.sh .env.production
```

The Terraform path provisions VPC, subnet, security group, ECS, and EIP:

```bash
cp deploy/volcengine/terraform.tfvars.example \
  deploy/volcengine/terraform.tfvars
./scripts/deploy-volcengine.sh
```

## Configuration

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `ARK_API_KEY` | Required | Ark model API key. |
| `ARK_MODEL` | Required | Responses-capable endpoint or model ID. |
| `ARK_BASE_URL` | Beijing v3 endpoint | Ark OpenAI-compatible API URL. |
| `APP_AUTH_TOKEN` | Empty on loopback | Shared demo token; use 24+ random characters remotely. |
| `RUNTIME_PROVIDER` | `local-process` | `container` for disposable local Runtime containers. |
| `CODEX_SANDBOX_MODE` | `workspace-write` | Codex inner sandbox mode. |
| `CODEX_TIMEOUT_MS` | `600000` | Maximum duration of one turn. |
| `LOCAL_POC_DATA_ROOT` | Platform-specific | Local metadata, workspace, and session directory. |

See [.env.example](.env.example) for all Runtime and resource-limit options.

## How it works

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    UI["React Web UI"] --> API["Fastify control plane"]
    API --> Store["JSON metadata and Agent workspaces"]
    API --> Runtime{"Runtime provider"}
    Runtime -->|Local POC| Container["Disposable Docker / Colima / Podman container"]
    Runtime -->|ECS profile| Codex["Codex CLI in application container"]
    Container --> Ark["Volcengine Ark Responses API"]
    Codex --> Ark
```

The first turn uses `codex exec`; later turns resume the stored Codex thread.
Deleting an Agent archives its workspace under `workspaces/.deleted/`.

See [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) for component and extension
boundaries.

## Validation

```bash
npm run check
terraform fmt -check -recursive deploy/volcengine
docker compose config
```
